# refactorHomeworkOne

## Discription

-This refactor was done for the homework given on 3-5-22.
-The purpose of the assignment was to refactor a website.
-The refactor was given guildlines to set the site up to be more accessible.
-I learned that it takes some time but is worth the effort for those who cannot use a computer the average way.

## Changes made
   css changes
    -changed the font to display the same throughout the page.
    -changed the horiseon header text to a single color for the visually impared.
    -Adjusted the font of the aside and sections to be slightly larger.
    -Commented on all css interactions.
   Html changes
    -Set <title> element to horiseon consulting,this doesnt feel kosher.
    -Changed the <div> elements into more specific elements.(such as:<nav><article><aside><footer><header>)
    -Added <alt> text everywhere I could find that didnt have <alt> text
    -fixed the first link in the <nav> bar so that it would link down to the corect <article> <section>


## License?
    -I havent wrapped my head around this just yet,will look to feedback and study more to fill in this gap.
